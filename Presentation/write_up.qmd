# Research Question

## Policy Background

- In recent years, unprecedented climate changes, particularly extreme heat, have affected regions across the globe. 

- In the United States, extreme heat has scorched much of the country, rapidly increasing heat-related deaths. 

- This alarming trend highlights the urgent need for effective response measures. 

## Chicago's Climate Policy

- In 2008, Chicago adopted the Chicago Climate Action Plan (CCAP), which aimed to reduce the city's greenhouse gas emissions by 25% compared to 1990 levels by 2020. 

- Initially, adaptive strategies were implemented, such as the installation of green roofs and reflective roofs on buildings. 

  - These measures aimed to reduce heat absorption, enhance urban cooling, and provide immediate relief from rising temperatures.

  - However, the city recognized these actions as temporary solutions. 

- In 2020, Chicago launched the Chicago Retrofit Roadmap, a three-year project to reduce carbon emissions at their source.

## Our Research Question: 

To evaluate the effectiveness and necessity of Chicago's evolving climate policies, our research seeks to answer the following questions:

* Did the 2008 CCAP continually reduce Chicago's greenhouse gas emissions before 2020?

* Can the Chicago Retrofit Roadmap further reduce carbon emissions and provide sustainable long-term solutions?

# Research Method And Coding Instructions

## Research Design

- To address the research questions, we aimed to uncover trends in greenhouse gas emissions, electricity usage, and natural gas consumption in Chicago. 

- We used data visualizations to evaluate the impact of the 2008 Climate Action Plan (CCAP) before 2020 and the Chicago Retrofit Program after 2020.

## Dataset Selection 

- Due to limited public data, we used the Chicago Energy Benchmarking Report, which contains self-reported energy data from existing buildings, collected annually since 2014. 

- Our analysis focused on data from 2017 to 2022 to easily divide trends into three years before and after 2020. 

## Challenge 
- The dataset only contained 8,113 parcel-level observations—about 1% of Chicago's buildings

- Data inconsistencies accour, such as missing or incorrect values, which required substantial preprocessing to ensure accurate results.

- **Solusion** 
  - we concentrated on **identifying overarching trends**, using an efficiency metric derived from the available data.

# Results

## Geometric Maps
As we want to see the overall change，we generated geometric maps of greenhouse gas emissions, gas consumption, and electricity consumption in Chicago communities for 2017 and 2022 to observe changes.

## `greenhouse gas emissions` map

- The decrease trend suggests that the 2008 CCAP and the Chicago Retrofit Roadmap initiatives to curb emissions have been somewhat effective.

## `gas consumption` map

- Similar results can also be drawn from gas and electric consumption.

- Similar results can also be drawn from gas and electric consumption. 

## Three Shiny Apps
To further see the trends, we build three shiny apps to explore energy efficiency trends across different communities and property types in Chicago. 

```{python}
#| echo: false 
# 这里提前打开3个shiny apps
# Users can select a specific community and variable type (Electricity, Gas, or Greenhouse Gas) to visualize the trend over time. The line chart shows the yearly changes in efficiency metrics, allowing users to easily understand how energy efficiency has evolved from 2017 to 2022. The app also provides a data table next to the graph, displaying the exact efficiency values for each year, which helps users examine detailed numerical data alongside the visual trends. 

## 直接在图上说findings: 
# shiny 1: most of the communities' GHG emissions were reduced from 2017 to 2022, and 2020-2022 reduced more sharply than 2017-2020. This implicated that both the 2008 CCAP and Chicago Retrofit maps work. 
# shiny 2: Besides,as the second Shiny app cannot clearly show the patterns as it lacks data on some property types, and most trends are increasing, we filtered the top 500 least efficient buildings. 
# shiny 3: through this new Shiny app, we can clearly see that multifamily housing, offices, and K12 Schools are the top 3 least efficient property types.
```

# Further Discussion for Furture Work

## Furture Work
For future improvements:

  -  we plan to expand our dataset to include more building types and data beyond 2022 to further explore the impact of the Chicago Retrofit Roadmap. 
  
  - Additionally, we aim to acquire historical data from 1990 to assess whether the 2020 levels of emissions and energy usage are indeed 25% of those in 1990, as outlined in Chicago's climate goals. 

  - Furthermore, we need to develop a more sophisticated model to better distinguish the effects of the 2008 CCAP and the Chicago Retrofit Roadmap, ensuring that we can accurately attribute observed changes to each initiative. 

This will help us more precisely evaluate the effectiveness of these policies and provide more targeted recommendations for future climate action.
